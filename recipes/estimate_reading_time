1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

2. Design the Method Signature
Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

calculate_reading_time(text)

text is a string  

Return value should be a integer representing minutes

3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.


calculate_reading_time("words " * 100)
calculate_reading_time("words " * 200)
calculate_reading_time("words " * 201)
calculate_reading_time("words " * 501)
calculate_reading_time("  ")


Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
